## Installation

To install `rs_fsl`, run

```
pip install rs_fsl
```


If you plan to make changes to the code, use

```
git clone https://github.com/bleykauf/rs_fsl.git
cd rs_fsl
pip install .
```
## Usage


```python
from rs_fsl import FSL
```

Connecting to the instrument. If the RS FSL is not connected to the phyics network, the address might be different and can be set manually with the `ip` keyword.


```python
fsl = FSL(ip='141.20.46.198')

Successfully connected to Rohde&Schwarz,FSL-18,100193/018,2.30
```

    
    


## Getting and setting parameters

Most parameters are implemented as properties in python, which means they can be read and written (getting and setting) in a consistent and simple way. If numerical values are provided, base units are used (seconds, hertz, decibel,...). 


```python
# Getting the current center frequency
fsl.freq_center

9000000000.0
```
    
```python

# Changing it to 10 MHz by providing the numerical value 
fsl.freq_center = 10e6
```


```python
# Verifying:
fsl.freq_center

10000000.0
```
    
```python
# Changing it to 1 GHz by providing a string and verifying the result
fsl.freq_center = '9GHz'
fsl.freq_center

9000000000.0
```

    

```python
# Setting the span to maximum
fsl.freq_span = '7GHz'
```

## Reading a trace

We will read the current trace


```python
x, y = fsl.read_trace()
```

## Markers

Markers are implemented as their own class. You can create them like this:


```python
m1 = fsl.create_marker()
```

Set peak exursion:


```python
m1.peak_excursion = 3
```

Set marker to a specific position:


```python
m1.x = 10e9
```

Find the next peak to the left and get the level:


```python
m1.to_next_peak('left')
m1.y

-34.9349060059

```







### Delta markers

Delta markers can be created by setting the appropriate keyword.


```python
d2 = fsl.create_marker(is_delta_marker=True)
d2.name

'DELT2'
```

## A example program

Program for measuring a beatnote


```python
m1 = fsl.create_marker() # create marker 1

# Set standard settings, set to full span
fsl.continuous_sweep = False
fsl.freq_span = '18 GHz'
fsl.rbw = "AUTO"
fsl.vbw = "AUTO"
fsl.sweep_time = "AUTO"

# Perform a sweep on full span, set the marker to the peak and some to that marker
fsl.single_sweep()
m1.to_peak()
m1.zoom('20 MHz')

# take data from the zoomed-in region
fsl.single_sweep()
x, y = fsl.read_trace()
```
